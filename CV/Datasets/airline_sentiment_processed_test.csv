 I've witnessed a manager named Denise yell at 2 different customers with my same issue. ,0

 Hands down the worst airline to travel with. Really really fucking bad.,0
 is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.,0
 what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs,0
 No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.,0
" yes we did make it home. But by no means am I happy. I've always chosen AA as my 1st choice when flying, I'm rethinking that...",0
 still waiting on a dm response..... ,0
  that can be a stop over before Paris. You are an embarrassment,0
  being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe,0
 highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with  you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items,0
 just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.,0

 this has happens so many times. It's just upsetting to see how poorly an airline treats their customers,0

 I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.,1
" seriously, you hate  since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny",0
 gotta be worse than  w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.,0
 In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?,0
 was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.,0
 won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...,0
 It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems,0
" I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks",0
 no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg,0
 I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? ,0
 you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the  yet,0
 none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid,0
 I'm booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I'm good. Stay warm and safe.,1
 So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....,0
  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.,0
 what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone,0
"  , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?",0
 Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?,0
" Thanks for the reply, but a functioning plane four hours ago was the only way to do that. The staff was friendly, tho.",1
Thank you for sending more details  : They're pretty handy dandy. more info here: http://t.co/FvlxIRh1F1 ,1
 aa223 being ignored,0
" FYI twice now I've tried the ""we'll call you when someone is free"" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up.",0
 that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today,0
 usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F,0
"  just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time",0
 absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.,0
" I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault.",0
" I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane 😢😕😦 ",0
 is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand,0
 I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.,0
 you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.,0
 it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items,0
 all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.,0
 the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.,0
  Good luck at DFW this evening AA!,1
 so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.,0
" on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting",0
 Awesome customer service on  from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx!,1
 flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food,0
"  I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful 😳",0
" seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF",0
  I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.,0
"  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks.",0
" just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams.",0
 approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on  flight 3056 - Oscar performance,0
" - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight.",0
 makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose,0
 AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.,0
 how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? ,0
 I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on  for $382 but their mileage program sucks.,0
" Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ",0
 the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out,0
 the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? ,0
 never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. ,0
" looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks.",0
 my  sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can't get an agent. They've called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help?,0
 My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y’all hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?,0
 anxious to see how you all care for customers you’ve inconvenienced  Flightledflight,0
" also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy.",0
" Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick ""Goodbye"" Very Sad!",0
 VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!,0
 already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.,0
 you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?,0
" yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though 😒 I'm really mad about the situation",0
" whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won't stray anymore. I'm talking about you !",0
"  between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer...",0
" I need help with a reservation purchased on  but operated on , can't get through on the 800#",0
  flight from DFW to LIT tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled.  What do I do next?  Pls advise.  ,0
 how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!,0
 my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund?,0
 thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome,1
 I can't choose a seat online because I booked on  ??? ,0
 it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.,0
" ""overweight"" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is.",0
 at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?,0
" Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled.",0
 Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....,0
 I ended up on a flight to LA my fourth time on standby. Thanks! http://t.co/NA5G5EAKPA,1
 been waiting on hold for more than an hour,0
 thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won't be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning.,0
" that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses.",1
 spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.,0
 thanks for the show! 👍,1
" well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel ",0
 no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :),1
" Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!",0
"  see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits",0
" , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous ",0
  not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!,0
  this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center,0
 Great seats on this aircraft!,1
Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at  ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one plane😡,0
 AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!,0
 a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!,0
 The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.,0
 we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers,0
"  no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs",0
"  ""here for you"" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or....",0
  was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.,0
 You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful,0
"  why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got",0
 DONE!! thank you so much!!,1
 Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs,0
 then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue,0
 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.,0
" delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag.  http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS",0
" Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?",0
 this is awful customer service.,0
 everything's good now brothaaaaaa,1
 its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired,0
  translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.,0
 OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK,0
 we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with,0
" 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!",0
"  no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots",0
 pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap,0
 I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!,0
 yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please,0
 unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth,0
 flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded,0
 I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.,0
 we need a miracle  please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640   ,0
 i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!,0

 Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?,0
" i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?",0
 Close down,0
 it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let's get another great leg too tonight!,1
 i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.,1
 AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.,0
 I’ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.,0
 you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it,0
 I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.,0
 now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone,0
 your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight,0
 yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.,0
 I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us,0
 My flight to  was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!,0
 I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(,0
 not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....,0
 I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.,0
 Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..,0
 Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!,0
 big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.,0
 really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and  are useles,0
 Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?,0
 is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?,0
 I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!,0
 tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.,0
 all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.,0
 how hard is it to have catering ready to go?,0
 Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?,0
 this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight . JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.,0
" I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz.",0
 flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting,0
 I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?,0
 my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight,0
 if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.,0
" versus  
in Customer Service?
Who will win!
For Me  is a convenience to a trip to Cali &lt;3",1
" agents refuse to help, ""too busy"" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO",0
 fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight?  Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold ,0
 ah if only we could get through. We've tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call ?,0
 this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.,0
" of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins",0
 I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!,0
 pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault,0
 trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.,0
 understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day,0

 help us here !!! We are stuck here  for more than 24hours! !we need to go home  ,0
 lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I'll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr.,0
 Flight  AA1691 LAX to LAS closes too early and gate agents give us hassles ,0
 I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...,0
" here we go again  ""Plane not ready"". Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night ",0
 flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded,0
" why does your customer service line say ""we are experiencing high call volume"" and then spontaneously hangup on the person?",0
 well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up   try paying overtime and bring in more people,0
