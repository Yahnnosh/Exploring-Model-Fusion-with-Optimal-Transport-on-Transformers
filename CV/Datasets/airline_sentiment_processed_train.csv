 already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..,0
 once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again,0

 I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert.  ,0
 Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. ,0
 when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.,0

 received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?,0
 Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. ,0
" and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!",0
 The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks.    ,1
" my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!",0
 Ha‚Ä¶ you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.,0
 switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!,0
 traveling with  who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY ,1
    how long will1531 be delayed.,0
 Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board,0
 I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too?  knows better..,0
 i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!,0
 you suck.    9 hour delay?!,0
 you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down.,0
" JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes.",0
 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!,0
. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?,0
 Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport,0
 AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!,0
 still no response??,0
 should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me,0
" There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver...""",0
 Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.,0
 My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.,0
 my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?,0
 Thanks!,1
 768 SFO to BOS and no internet it is 2015 what gives?,0

 I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!!,0
" I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way",0
 Late Flight crew into  last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to . Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in ?,0
 no they aren't - I just called to check. ,0
 passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines),0
" been solved,  they finally picked up the second time I called,  thanks for the response JH!  7:21 to dulles works!",1
" need to work on your   program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants.",0

" Beyond frustrated  Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover.  Of course only seats are $$++.  Cust svc no help",0
" working with Lisa J at ORD. she's working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR.",0
 love the new 1st class breakfast!,1
 i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I'm still irritated w/ united.,0
" flight Cancelled Flightled,  and the updated one gets me into BWI too Late Flight! I'd be fine with DCA or IAD,  just arriving earlier!  Help!",0
 so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor.,0
 at this point I made it home on my own.,0
 Thanks for looking into this and for getting back to me via DM. Glad to hear my bag is finally being delivered to me. Thanks again!,1
" I would like to talk to a customer service agent about the service / non service I received on my last flight a a week or so a go.
J",0
" you Cancelled Flight my flight. I wait in line to get rebooked, when I'm at the front you make me go to another gate and I lose my place.",0
 it wasn't a comment. It was a question. But thanks for your copy and paste response,0
" you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that's it!",0
 We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR,0
 flew from sdf to ATL to Tampa on Delta. Left early. Arrived early. Crew helpful. Wifi worked!!,1
 how about starting without the robotic response?,0
" You can't control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here.",0
" Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I've ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck.",0
" yes, but it's not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR",0
 I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! ,0
 flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500,0
 I'm on hold for the 4th time waiting for you to resolve and issue with a flight for my 6-year-old son.  ,0
 Cool. Thank you.,1
 I'd like to thank and recognize Terri P at Dulles for going out of her way to get me back on my Raleigh flight,1
 as a freq flyer it makes me sad to see cust needing assistance treated so poorly. ,0
 day 3 of this Saga maybe they'll finally make it home.Intentional or not it not gonna get them back there vacation days ,0
" No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again.",0
 current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp; why not make this option available online?,0
 I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE,0
 also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.,0
 jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it's our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy,0
. Not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!,0
 WHERE IS MY RECEIPT! I upgraded return leg and 6 months Late Flightr still NO receipt! http://t.co/DAjWzhLVyu,0
 how is it that I book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out I have no seat?  WTF.,0
" they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful.",0
 I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!,0
 wi-fi on 737-800 (aircraft 3511) didn't work entire ORD-DCA flight this morning,0
" Cancelled Flightled my direct flight Newark-Brussels last night, now 7 hours behind schedule. In EU compensation would be a given, but in US?",0

  on  as flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco now going to Chicago as flight crew out of hours due to de-icing delay,0
" I'm aware of the flight details, thanks. Three hours Late Flight a crew that could not give less of a shit",0
 Making sure your flights aren't delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start.,0
 hilarious,0
 hahahahaha ya tried that already,0
" ""Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages.""",0
 funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. ,0
" nope not here. You need a little red stamp from the counter. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself son http://t.co/0pRGySvuRm",0
" wasn't trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee",0
 unhappy with your new mileage rules :( - was my main reason to keep flying united. Will have to take my business elsewhere,0
 I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly  again.,0
" you've been officially displaced by  for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching!",0
 you need a bag bouncer. Get it together,0
  what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?,0
" you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool.",0
UA3388  was Cancelled Flightled not delayed.  Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home.  At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation.,0
 never ever again will I be Flight Booking Problems a flight with United or any affiliate if there is a chance to get on a United flight,0
 Was able to send the DM. All good now.,1
 three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats...,0
 and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it's fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly,0
 - it's been almost 2 weeks and still no word from DOT on update of london fare to us cities? any updates on your end?,0
 well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight,0
 Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.,0
 no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house,0
 have Michelle at T1 ORD train your other staff on how to treat customers. A refreshing pleasure to deal with.,1
" I guess you have to ""follow"" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send.",0
" Stopped flying  1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon  listening to pssngrs forced to chk,",0
 I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked?,0
" just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage?",0
" why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to ""check in"" at counter?   ",0
 very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight.,0
 an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... ,0
 an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff,0
" - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your ""Premier"" groups might be an indication of a broken process.",0
 EWR agent Barbara was FABULOUS and an example of CUST. SERV. A pleasure talking to youüòä http://t.co/KMQuLY9g5E,1

" flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH",0
 Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.,0
 literally sucks,0
 thanks for the upgrade today great way to start my week! Cc:  ,1
 Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS,0
 I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.,0
 this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really?,0
 really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight &amp; -going via Nashville? . Downgraded but not on ticket,0
 I am impressed with your super-fast reply to ,1
" hi JP, with the help of an awesome TSA representative, I was able to get it all taken care of. Thank you!",1
" First complaint filed on Feb 11th, over 10 days now and still no response....disappointed but not surprised....",0
 Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?,0
 please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve . 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable,0
 it's 430am and wife still doesn't have her luggage which was promised by 8pm and said to be on its way File number: DCA48810M ,0
 was trying to change a flight online but got an error can you help via DM?,0
 the staff was rather efficient and got us solutions just freaked me out a little being in limbo in the air.,1
 you are terrible.,0
" I'm glad you didn't mean to, but it doesn't excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight",0
 I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a 'error' message. I hope you didn't still charge me.,0
 ‚Ä¶ But friendly efficient air attendants in coach  http://t.co/49pV3KcHNR,0
" Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power &amp; lifevests on the floor  ‚Ä¶",0
 Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.),0
 on plane to Newark now. I was checked in as Rebecca Levi. My bag is under her name too.,0
 aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won't be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how's that for patience?,0
  ual sucks,0
 not happening.  Delta took care of us.  Peace!,0
BUT  just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL &amp; back to DC in same time. ,0
 you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again ,0
" appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue",0
" Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (""uplink prob""). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?",0
 so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United,0
" Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage.",0
" after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!",0
 doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.,0
 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.,0
 I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1,0
 Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz,0
 Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????,0
 One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.,0
 that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons,0
 I wanna be grand staff,1
" SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why...",0
 that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate,0
 also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.,0
 your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.,0
 I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane,1
" after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??",0
 checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. ,0
" what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?",0
" Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ",0
" I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don‚Äôt see that it has taken off yet",0
 thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted,0
" This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?",0
" If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means.",0
" It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United",0
 why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead,0
 On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.,0
 Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.,0
" Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. ",0
 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence,0
 big surprise  waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you.  ,0
" Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx",0
 maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE!  always the same thing w/u,0
 I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?,0
" even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded",0
 I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.   ,0
" Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip.",0
 Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx,0
 you're my early frontrunner for best airline! ,1
"  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.",0
 You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!,0
 was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. ,0
 Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim.   ,1
 will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels ,0
" you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS",0
 does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? ,0
 Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!,0
" typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!",0
 is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??,0
 customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.,0
 was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic,0
" love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away",0
" tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error).",0
 it will be on a different airline.,0
 and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.,0
" clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59",0
 you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support,0
 tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!,0
 quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2,0
" yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around.",0
 Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2,0
 i need help but in spanish,0
" A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online",0
 I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?,0
 UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...,0
 either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...,0
 considering it. Currently gold on . Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?,0
" worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. ",0
 customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think,0
 it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi,0
 will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers,1
" bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA",0
 yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier,0
 compensate us for new clothes bet you won't,0
 I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!,1
", we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)",0
 yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed ,0
 currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams,0
" I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage""",0
 your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...,0
 - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.,0
 is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do,0
 there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.   ,0
 here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?,0
 you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections,0
" if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?",0
 the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?   ,0
 he is so excellent and so reliable :) ,1
 but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS,0
 its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service',0
 it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!,1
" really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc.",0
"-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business.",0

 I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?,0
 Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!,0
 thank you!,1
 that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back,0
  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay . not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.,0
 Why is my time less important to you?    ,0
 airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? ,0
 I did. It took about an hour and a half though,0
 Why have you never held a plane for me?   ,0
 i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(,0
 WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M,0
 I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.,1
 Made to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa,0
 time to give up my 1K status and switch to  - you are so terrible I can't even describe.,0
" Thanks! LOL!  will wait for us. Per , same tail number as  :)",1
 You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.,0
  now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. ,0
 Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.,0
 many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?,0
 You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.,0
 we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing,0
" ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1",0
 what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???,0
 except all of that delayed the flight anyway.,0
 maybe find a different gate ,0
 I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever...  ,0
 landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?,0
 wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke,0
 can we get an explanation on why UA978 from S√£o Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.,0
 Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.,0
" I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option.",0
", wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. ",0
 not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge,0
 is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on . They took pressure cooker to a new level.  ,0
 why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always,0
 Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.,0
 sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent,0
" on  tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?",0
", take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo.",0
 bummer but thank you for the quick response,1
 I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.,0
 didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.,0

 and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there,0
 and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse,0
 I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse,0

 thank you! Excited to be working with you guys!,1
 And yet we still haven't left yet and I can't watch my pre-paid DirectTV. ,0
 yr team have me on hold for over an hour unhelpful Pls can you answer my question.,0
. Let us know when you find everyone's luggage. Thanks. ,0
 Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.,0
" Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm.",0
 just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight ,0
 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help?,0
 website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet.  ,0
 From the air: Another missed cnxn 2day. ATC went on strike in Belize this AM. Now family &amp; I miss cnxn in EWR. Please see my DMs.,0
 we are the airline that has Cancelled Flightled flights TOMORROW to the NYC area,0
 having to pay for a hotel room in Cleveland because of last minute Cancelled Flightled connecting flight. Booked through united..Unimpressed!,0
 I was on UA3782 and it was Cancelled Flightled. I'm waiting at customer service.,0
 Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!,0
 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks,0
 congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.,0
" thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!",0
 how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? ?,0
Reply to  - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.,0
 15-hr flight w/broken  media system. Witness   as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.,0
 I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.,0
 never again.,0
 tonight you made this Fred Flintstone happy with an upgrade to 1st class. http://t.co/gKgKZLAwpR,1
 is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.,0
  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest,0
 fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.,0
 that's great! pls let me know when u start!,1
" God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit.",0
 you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed,0
 sucks.,0
 I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?,0
 is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
 Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded . Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.,0
 thanks ... not sure arranged move to the earlier flight but I'm at the gate with a seat assignment.  Super nice agent at gate C4 ORD,1
 quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK,0
 No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. ,0
 We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.,0
" yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent.",0
 Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.,0
 I see. Thanks for explaining.,1
 Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned ,0
 If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.,0
" After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me.",1
" Yes, they did. Must have fixed the broken ramp. Thanks!",1

 you have failed so uncontrollably today that it's beyond repair. I'm beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations.,0
 A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed?,0
 I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.,0

 haven‚Äôt before and haven‚Äôt this time &amp; have checked spam/junk mail just in case‚Äînothing,0
 sloppy stuff you don't see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor,0
 how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email?,0
" no bag tagging, led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags",0
" cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers",0
 allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane,0
 no wheelchairs,0
" no commitment to a good turnaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance",0
 the nightmare continues... http://t.co/TsvgbrL15f,0
 this team added 30 mins on turnaround,0
" as a million miler with UA, and flying almost every week I observe gate and flight crews committed to good operations",1
 call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer,0
" thanks, we did.",1
" yes, I've been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me.",0
 thank you for compensating us for our 4 lost bags. We will fly with you again! ,1
 we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!,0
", no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt",0
" what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection",0
" Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct?",0

 but your system gave my seat away.now I'm 27L Economy! Not Econ + seat. How did you give my plus seat away?,0
 I JUST ASKED MY BOYFRIEND TO PROM OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER ON FLIGHT 494 HE SAID YES!!!! BEST DAY EVER!!! THANK U SO MUCH!!!!!!,1
" yep‚Äîused that twice; no case id numbers assigned; just tried it again-get screen that says, ‚Äúthank you for submitting your request‚Äù",0

So appreciated! ,1
 Hmmm...seems like this could be something to be changed to be more .,1
 No problem just follow me back so I can! Thank you!,1
 any help is appreciated. That's a LOOONG wait for help on something that's not his fault,0
 my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours. You Cancelled Flighted his flight and there's a 1hr wait on phone,0
 is probably the least satisfactory airline I've ever been on. Never fails to disappoint.,0
 this flight has been amazing. This is the best flight I have ever been on I am not kidding. Service is INCREDIBLE!,1
 not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care,0
 who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in  right now.,0
 I fly  normally.  This doesn't happen to me with them.  I'll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you.,0
 the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!,1
 how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail,0
 Rhonda C. at Atlanta airport redeemed you guys. She got us straightened out.,1
" ok so what is being done about my experience? My family had a terrible experience for $1,200. It's kind of like being robbed.Explain",0
 great job losing one of my six bags on a direct flight.  Don't know how you manage to do it.,0
 the worst customer service in Denver.,0
" ruined my day &amp; start trip SFO to GIG. both legs changed, lost my paid upgrade &amp; 200 1st class seat &amp; moved me from Econ + to Econ",0
 now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse,0
 have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals,0
 No wonder the cabin is filthy. ,0
" And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, ""not with my hands!"" ",0
 I need  to be a better airline!!,0
 flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can't help me,0
" Hi there, looks like my connection is delayed too so I'll make it. Thanks!",1
" Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You're welcome. ",0
 You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross!,0
 cldnt be happier w the many plastic wing pins given to me on flight 494. I love them! Amazing staff! So nice http://t.co/CbV7f3KBKx,1

 ROC flight Cancelled Flightled. Love my snowy drive home with no useful substitutes,0
 that's a crazy long form! You need something other than a video?,0
 I hope not to see the same issue on my return flight tomorrow,0

 You shouldn't page o'head that it's best to call 1-800# - on hold 26+ mins,0
 thanks for the reply.  If you can get me a better seat on my next leg to Munich. That would be nice.,1
 appreciate getting put on hold for 20min and then getting hung up on because I was requesting help for big group. I'll try ,0
 thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list.,0
  or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around.,0
 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.,0

 outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first,0
 Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.,0
 bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! ,0

" I'm on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that's in UnitedFirst.",0
" Bringing your ""A"" game with premium cabin dining. Nice! https://t.co/zgOQoxjBQY",1
 you already have vomit so you are halfway there,0
 is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!,0
" fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff",0
 they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.,0
 you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? ,0
" time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United",0
" it was an international flight, and we didn't get our new eta until we were in the air.",0
 - I think she was having a rough moment w/ a bad passenger from an earlier flight. Things got considerably better. Thanks!,1
 - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello  !,0
" Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out.",0

 $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?,0
  Unbelievable hypocrisy!!,0
 thanks for not getting my BusinessFirst priority tagged bag onto my connecting flight at EWR despite a 2+ hour layover. Nice job,1

" On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this.",0
 now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...,0

 The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5,0
" She met me from customer service at the arrival of flight UA3787 PVD-IAD. Thanks, you guys have really handled this storm!",1
 ooh thanks!,1
" my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55.",0
 very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable,0
 exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it,0
I feel completely cheated . I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.,0
"  0162431184663.
3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket.",0
 if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff,0
 IT-problems with the link? ,0
": I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5",0
 Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me,0
 can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....,0
 thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too,1
 was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. ,0
 Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.,0
 $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...,0
 FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.,0
" so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67",0
: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. ,0
 once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!,0
 can you not see the thread?,0
 poor old United: never seem to get the response right :),0
 obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful  worst airport,0
 also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.,0
 thanks! :),1
"Hypocrisy RT   I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP",0
 I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL,0
  eventually.  You should approach bags like   they get it.,0
 What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?,0
 said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.,0
 how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.,0
 we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.,0
" if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!",0
" wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united.",0
 I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!üëéüëé,0
  don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!,0
 I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!,0
 well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus,0
" how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!",0
 You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. ?,0
  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ,0
" Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line.",0
" Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks",0
 if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?,0
 Classic,0
 Elizabeth at Washington Dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate! I'm super pleased!,1
 Thanks!,1
 flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?,0
 A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.,0
" thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united",0
 If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.,0
 just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available,0
  so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? ,0
" so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?",0
 stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail,0
   What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage ,0
 No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.,0
 calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.,0
 They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.,0
 I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.,0
 Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(,0
 JT thanks for your help I‚Äôll complete the form once we are back home,1
" missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight...",0
 You might be dealing with frustrated passenegers. hope you all have a great day :) thank you very much for an amazing airline :),1
 yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !,0
 thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.,0
 But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.,0
" My flight UA1159 to Denver for  has been re-cheduled 5 times.
If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous.",0
 you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond,0
 JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service,0
" here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!",0
 I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone,0
 thank you! I wish the lady in Little Rock had told me that in the morning when I asked her,1
 no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?,0
" Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your ""fine print,"" haha",1
 worst service ever üòà,0
 thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?,0
 can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice,0
 I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United,0
 holy high speed internet batman!  Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast!  Thanks,1
 Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.,0

" thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight.",0
 Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL  today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying .,0
 it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.,0
 I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.,0

" Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it.",0
" Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)",0
 Sure did! Only waited about 15min. Yay!,1
" Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag.",0

" I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years.",0
Is expiring the  offer to buy or transfer   miles with discount? Many offers during a year http://t.co/6tz6imqZlG,1
" no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation",0

" Thanks, ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class.",1
 flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?,0
 bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.,0
 who can tell me where they are?,0
" flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful.",0
 each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!,0
 flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on,0
 waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) ,0
 I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.,0
 I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats,0
 its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!,0
 thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...,0
 - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.,0
" I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home.",0

 with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept,0
" she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke",0
" nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus.",0
 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter,0
 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused,0
" on a good note, the 2 employees I encountered @ Newark were fabulous. I was very Late Flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!!",1
 u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.,0
 yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!!,0

 WiFi onboard 737-800 far superior in pricing and performance (user-perceived bandwidth and Late Flightncy) to recent  experiences.,1
 Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!,0
 when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.,0
 Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful.,0
 thankful for great service in Newark. Seats fixed and I was seated with my daughter! Fab landing in Fort Myers!,1
 my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. We're on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh,0
 is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really!,0
 Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home,0
 spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.,0
 costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response,0
 I somehow think I'm going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime.  I guess we'll see.,0

" no worries about the tweets. We all should do what we can to make sure we, as in your tag line, ""Fly the Friendly Skies.""",1
  I am thankful to the  United ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. Home Late Flight is still home!,1
 I appreciate the follow up.,1

 BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +,0

 No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business.,0

" For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?",0
 Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.,0
 Don't apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM.,0
 after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy üò£,0

" come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip.",0
" When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ.",0
 I only fly Jet Blue,1
 Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I'm all in,1
 thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free?,1
's flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great!,1
 still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.,0
 thanks for making my trip home  next  flight I'll take more selfies!   ,1
"  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was.",0
 if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?,0
 I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.,0
" If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it.",0
 our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.,0
 I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.,0
 also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.,0
  out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky,0
  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!,0
 Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected,0
 I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO,0
 what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!,0
"‚Äú:  Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! :)  Enjoy the ride!‚Äù Thank you!",1
 My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong,0
" According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!",0
. thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours.  ,0
 At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong,0

 she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight,0
 . Flight  is departing before we even board,0
 I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. Great job,1

 loves Cancelled Flightling tickets and not telling their customers ,0
 tickets were confirmed and sent out. find out today that they Cancelled Flightled our tickets months ago and never sent an email ,0
 would have been good to know months ago that you Cancelled Flightled our flights leaving tomorrow   ,0
" rather than trying to resolve customer issues, only options offered were paying cash @ airport or write letter. ",0
 I'm on flight and no booze being served 30 min in... What gives?   ,0
 I've used you guys for 10 years but after this experience I will NEVER EVER use you again.,0
 managers telling us to write a letter because we're upset about our tickets to leave tomorrow getting Cancelled Flightled without any notice,0
 you guys are lucky I love you,1
 Maybe stop telling people the wrong info on your customer service calls.,0
" customer service was so bad updating my points, once I use my next points, I won't be flying you. Point system is almost a sham.",0
 ruining vacations left and right. Who would have thought an airline can Cancelled Flight tickets without telling the buyer,0
 better find a way to get me to Puerto Rico tomorrow morning besides charging us three times in cash what we originally paid,0
 I spent over an hour of my morning on hold w/ your customer support. I want my confirmed flight to be taken care of,0
   does it look like to we talked to customer service? http://t.co/vYUAnh4Iqr,0
" claims w/ customer protection they ""will notify customers of delays, Cancelled Flightlations and diversions.""  http://t.co/3oq1T4ohjl",0

 that's not an option for us. So how can we help each other fix this? I would've made the change earlier if given accurate info.,0

" even  responded quicker via Twitter when they .... Still on hold, hoping no one books the flight.....  ",0

 so technically I could drive to JFK now and put in. Request for tomorrow's flight?,0
 why did I pay for extra space to be forced to put my backpack under my seat? Its my only bag. Flight 135. Unprofessional.,0

 you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.,0
 ... I f@$%ing hate you.,0
 travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund,0
" Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL",0
 no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called u . You said you should call travel agency but,0
" finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks.",0
 well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat,0
" : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable.",0
" yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing!",0
   Not good. On hold for over an hour. http://t.co/wSgYckCIIO,0
" no worries, your flight attendant took care of it.",1
 I've been on hold for over an hour.  Not doing so well in the customer service department.  ,0

  Urgently need to speak with a CS rep. My 50K miles havent shown &amp; I've fulfilled all reqs. Flight Booking Problems flights today,0

 I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back,0
  now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again.   it's no wonder you had to sell,0
" hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow.",0
 did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time.,0

 is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening,0
 good work by flight 1798 crew.  's recognition even in coach.  Too many  Late Flightly.  What's up with this?,1
 changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to  now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never.,0
 I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best,0
 sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways.,0
 It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone,0
 I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help,0
 I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645,0

 I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip,0
 what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.,0
 very embarrassing.,0
 I‚Äôm still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn‚Äôt up on current policy to argue with a traveler.,0
 yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... üòâ what about the impossible connection that started this?,0
 I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs,0
 and despite tailwind‚Ä¶ Will still be Late Flight.,0
 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations.com unmonitored. BAD,0
 Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues.,1
" i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them.",0
 and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits...,0

"  is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on  to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold?",0
 is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.,0
"  well there is certainly nothing happening ""in front"" of the scenes.   ",0
 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable,0
 customer service at its best! Rachel S.  took great care of us at the PHX airport. http://t.co/HG7vEqhGHy,1
  I will never fly us airways again.,0
 strikes again--Late Flight crew /4 for the trip and maintenance /4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays,0
 so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail,0
" yes, thanks but took forever",0
 as far as being delayed goes‚Ä¶ Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!,0
 horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05,0
" I asked if that was SOP, and they said ‚ÄúIt is now.‚Äù But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?",0
 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.,0
 it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.,0
 I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.,0
. Have you just given up?,0
. and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME.,0
 Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA),0
" Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am...",0
Great management of  twitter account. Thank you.,1
 why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?,0
 why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries?  ,0
 your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service,0
 great. I just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me,0
 IT HAS BEEN FOUND THANK YOU,1
  that's a lie.,0
 your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch.   ,0
 your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me.,0
" do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls!",0
 And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat,0

 She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too.  No help. ,0
 I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane,0
" awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH?",0
 I'll check it out when I get to the airport. Thanks.,1
 ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day.,0

 4 great flights with no delays! Thank you!,1
 been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous,0
 Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.,0
 honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????,0
 only happened because u couldn't get us home the next day.     ,0

 if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is.,0
 you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.,0
 cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.,0

 US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen!,0
 thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable,0

" US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard.",0
 US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.,0
 Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room!  http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq,0

" US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange.",0
 my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing,0

" Row 16, flight 634 today if you're looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need.",0
 seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!,0
" I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers.",0
 why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.,0

 Wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at Puerto Rico airport! üëç,1
" usually ""sorry"" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk.",0
 don't worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me,0

 Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?,0
 takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? ,0
 how long for a reply,0
 it was customer service like I have never seen before!  Kudos to your organization.,1
 Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... ,0

"  at 9:05am after the plane left: ""why were there no agents and why were the doors closed so early?""",0
 I called more than 25 times to redeem mile points and can't get through.  You advertise the miles but make them very hard to use!,0

 I need to speak with a live person. I've had it with the recordings. I was told on Sat that we'd have our luggage by yest.,0

 getting extremely frustrated w/ the phone/online service for merging frequent flyer miles.,0

" First the pilot was Late Flight, now it's maintenance. This is EXACTLY what happened two weeks ago. Unacceptable.",0
 I will NEVER fly us airways or american again and I will share this nightmare of a story to all the many others we know who fly,0
" i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying..",0

 you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date,0
 i worked with you and bought my own rental car when you failed to get me to the location i paid to get to and now....,0
 I've been on hold for 30 minutes and counting. ,0
 Discovered our flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday at 3:30PM -  finally notified us our flight was Cancelled Flighted at 0316 AM,0

‚Äú:  O‚Äù thank you for that elaborate response,1
 You guys are screwing up my trip. Thanks for nothing. ,0
 Seriously. This is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to wait a hour for my luggage after I land. ,0
 Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? ,0
 the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail,0
 hello??? Anyone there?,0
 forced sections 4 and 5 to check their carry on. would have packed differently to check my bag. Why even allow it? ,0
" Raleigh to Chicago and no  upgrade. Must be flying AA 'the screw USAir Elite, after we bailed them out' Airline",0
" flt 419. 2+ hrs Late Flight, baggage + 1 more hr. Now I see they delivered my suitcase wet inside &amp; out. ",0
 then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!,0
" so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help",0
 your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else,0
" as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise",0
 Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren't here 45 minutes Late Flightr,0
". wow, awful customer service.",0
 merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it.,0
 How many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls?,0
 YOU ARE THE BEST!!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)üôèüôèüôè,1

 three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!?,0
 on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. Can't say enough great things about our pilot. He's doing all he can for us.,1
 What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait.,0
" Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again.",0
 you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me.,0
 I've flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways,0
 pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this longüòí,0
 your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable,0
 What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore?,0
 I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form.  You guys are the best :),0
 Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up.  Recommend a call back feature.,0
 IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR???,0
 not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN,0

 how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems?,0
" Please don't trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience",0
 And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?,0
 sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?,0
 Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia?,0
 you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.,0
 But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.,0
 I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.,0
 there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!,0
" And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour!",0
" Already planning my local boycott for Washington, D.C. Area.",0
 I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.,0
 and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!,0
" you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service",0
 hey guys!  Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST!,0
"  he's fine, he really likes picking his own seat....",1
 is the worst airline to ever travel with.,0
" has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled.",0
 Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don't care????!!!,0
 now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep?,0

 it still says that I can't check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly,0
 this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn't left yet) so thanks for this useful information. ,0

" I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I've since learned  had one!",0
 delayed I'm charlotte big surprise,0
" Cancelled Flightled flight, 50 person line and one agent helping to rebook. You could've handed this one better. http://t.co/By3vDioSUA",0
 same here! On hold for an hour &amp; then told  has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. ,0
 what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL? Daughter and her fianc√©e are stuck in BOS!,0
" isn't it funny that  just apologizes, but doesn't actually take steps 2 go above &amp; beyond for customers? ",0
" 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA.",0
" We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????",0
 Thank you,1
 can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx,0
 Reservation agent on the phone did a great job.,1
" get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from  perhaps.",0
 is a joke. Stop losing my luggage!,0
" I've been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what's wrong?!?",0
" has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal!",0
 Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares?,0
 how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707?,0
 I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? ,0
" now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!",0
" I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made",0
" Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased.",0
 headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).,0
 made it!!! Send Bloody Mary's to row 27!!!,1
 I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back #,0
 the flights weren't from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday,0
 I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad.  ,0
 your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless,0
" never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed.",0
 sitting on the ground in Charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy Friday hope i make my connection,0
 I've been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for DCA-PIT. HELP!  http://t.co/jasKYPLWt5,0
" Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for ""maintenance"" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me.",0
" yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. ",0
 suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.,0
" 835, fix this ASAP",0
" No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care. We‚Äôre automated.""",0
"  , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!",0
 I'm logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it,0
 thanks for helping with  Booking Problems  Flightedflight Yvonne Anthony.  You will help us get to Tel Aviv on time.  ,1
 big thanks to Yvonne Anthony from the Chairman's desk.  Top tier customer service today.    &amp; .,1
 now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal.,0
 are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2,0
 now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.,0
 what is the damn delay????,0
 it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here,0
 app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.,0
 has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!,0
" And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless.",0
. You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.,0
" thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!",0
" need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at , and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!",0
" that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service",0
 why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate,0
 He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. ,0
 I appreciate your prompt response.,1
 nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice,0
 well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.,0
 I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable,0
 doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help ,0
 this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous,0
 we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.,0
 the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.,0
  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.,0
 is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.,0
 Thks US  2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.,1
 I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.,0
 this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air,0
 is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.,0
 hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days,0
 Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH,0
 ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????,0
" yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today.",0
 we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.,0
" Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too.   ",0
 First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off,0
" you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else",0
  delayed due to     We've heard it all! ,0
" ""Able""? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?",0
 is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.,0
 is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.,0
 today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.,0
 I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human.,0
 gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston,0
 on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!!,0
 thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it,1
 thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.,0
  I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.,1
 NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni,0
. I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.,0
" 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!",0
 this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated,0
 been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!,0
" it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical.",0
" never flying  again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service.",0
 we will...sunday! Just a few days away,1
 unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.,0
 I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE ,0
 Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.,0
" Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes",0
 why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.,0
 offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!,0
"‚Äú:  We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?‚Äù Spring Break !!!",1
 that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. ,0
 I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. üëå,1
 that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us,0
" that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. ",0
 Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!,1
" the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors",0
 I‚Äôll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/,0
 your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide.  ,0
 worst experience ever with you guys‚Ä¶see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.,0
 now the freezing bus is just doing circles?,0
" please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!",0
" I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice.",0
 why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?,0
 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?,0
 we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.,0
 doesn't want me to get home,0
" They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?",0
" DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!",0
" - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you.",0
" I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket.",0
 oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful,0
 that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.,0
 never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.,0
" my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? ",0
" Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection‚Ä¶ Help!",0
 the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.,0
 even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure ,0
 yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting,0
" Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment.",0
 - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs,0
 sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.,0
 you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.,0
 the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!,0
" 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??",0
" due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!",0
" we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home.",0
" ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded.",0
 FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab!  An asset to your team.  From 1F. Have a great night team!,1
 thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding.  ,0
 We're having 2 grandbabies in 2 weeks -- will travel to DC for the births. Thank you for the reasonable fares!  See you Saturday!,1
" Thank you, !  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than  and !  Thank you! You won me over!",1
 flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???,0
" I already HAVE, four times",0
" 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed.",0
 I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?,0
" I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman",1
" Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz!  flyer",0
 No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? ,0
" Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF",0
 thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway,0
" I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think even ONE.",0
   disappoints AGAIN!  Flighted flights  appointments  refund is a lie,0
 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on  !!! Ridiculous  ,0
" unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it.    ",0
" I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on ? It's been 6 days.",0
" ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/KigfKVXxDQ",0
 thanks for getting me rescheduled on a direct flight to NOLA tonight in 10 minutes--and hopefully an hour earlier getting there!,1
 problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways  5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight,0
 still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested.  Deal w this!!,0
" flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!",0
"  When will it be marked ""completed"". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded.",0
"  completed. If that's the case then why does it still say ""in progress"" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th.",0
" Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :)",0
 HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE,0
 thank you finally got our bag. Customer services reps were wonderful.,1
 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.,0
 never fails to disappoint.,0
 platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?,0
  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane .,0
" flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now",0
 flight 437 PHX&gt;ORD.  Lead FA Bill is the most professional FA I have seen in 9 years of flying USAir. I have no AB cards. :-(,1
 I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. I‚Äôve been on flight 1776 from BOS ‚Äî&gt; PHL so many times I should have a res. seat,1
  Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!!,0
 pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. ,0
  you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.,0
 no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!,1
 i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues,0
 should take a lesson from  and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..,0
" yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!",1
 thanks! Made it safely! http://t.co/KCqeBEej7S,1
 they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today,0
 tells me to talk to  about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. ,0
 what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight?,0
 this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.,0
 4420 delayed further?,0
 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there.,0
. I guess from now on I should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full.,0
 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection üò°,0
 over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.,0
" - love the changes in the lounge - cheese, veggies, olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix,",1
 thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw,1
 yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something,0
 please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ,0
 forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.,0
" Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!",0
 FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND,0
 $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility,0
 why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. ,0
 WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS.,0
 not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I'll keep you posted,0
 I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to  to be in my friend's wedding! ,0
 how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :(,0
"  poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more",0
" I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone.",0
 still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please,0
"‚Äú:  Thanks for your feedback, Alan.‚Äù Thx, but  no help as I watch a flt Lve w/open seats and I wait 3hrs for nxt flt",0
 lol me too,1
 still waiting on a response,0
 - who do I call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that can't be rebooked online?Rep I called quoted me $1k higher than the website.,0
 so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come.  ,0
 oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat,0
" thanks to the gate agent in State College, PA that was able to get me on an earlier flight AND figure out an earlier connection!",1
 I just think it's weird to have mileage as 666,1
 Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can't sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed.,0
 but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes,0
" worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? ",0
" your app is bad, and you should feel bad.",0
 Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning.,0
 is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes.  I hope you can fix it,0
" yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting",0
 You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home.,0
 has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible,0
  Will you be destroying lives in Eastern  during this lively little event? For profits you will.,0
 5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? ,0
 understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight.,0
 we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.,0
 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people  exec bene's not honored,0
 Cancelled Flightled due to maintenance. The plane was there for 10 hours. Get your shit together because there are a lot of people unhappy.,0
 a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its,0
" was switched to an American Airlines flight, not by choice, and now I am charged $50 for bags? Thought y'all merged?",0
 My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with  and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times...,0
 No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable.,0
 over an hour now and still no one at the Yuma counter,0
 now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck!,0
 some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative,0
  I feel sorry for AA,0
 there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!!,0
 what an amazing day. Delayed 4 hrs bc frozen h2o on plane Now sitting @ gate on same plane 4 30 mins still waiting! ,0
" Stuck in Philadelphia airport for 32 hours due to ""maintenance"". Dreading my flight back home. Disgusting.",0
 I'll sincerely regret Dividend miles! Good things coming to an end :(,0
 thanks,1
 thanks for telling me my flight was on time when the plane was broken. You're an inferior airline.,0
 I've called to resolve my dividend miles issue for a week to no avail.  Please advise ASAP.,0
 they finally answered. They were rude and didn't help me at all.,0
"  made flight , please thank the crew of 556 great time recovery",1
 - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!,1
 I've been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful,0
 1917. Still sitting here. Feels badly handled.,0
  Lilly M in SJU check in is fabulous!,1
 Was just on hold with you all for TWO HOURS and then got hung up on. oh my god.,0

 How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...,0
 if you could change your name to  and do what they do...that'd be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings.,0

 i hate you,0
" it is the same passenger, just her maiden name ended up as last name through online Flight Booking Problems.  Yes, understand non transferable",0
 understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem,0
 I paid for my seat.  I expect to be able to use my full seat,0
" if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat, what is my recourse?  ",0
 so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. ,0
" the gate agent said ""it's booked in full. Sorry"" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land.",0
" Empty 1st class, Chairman can't move up due 2 silly award travel rule trumping common sense - customer service fail again!",0
 you're the only airline that's not open sooner. It's not a confidence booster.,0
 checked in last night @ airport by supervisor w boarding pass for 1A - boarding today seat changed to 7F. How does that happen?,0
 new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. New can't get through TSA,0
 cardholder is flying.  We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating.,0
 this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service,0
 testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent.  130am,0
" flying from Manchester international to Philadelphia and getting emails about delays, no information about connecting flights..",0
" thank you.3860 to cincy.just landed.you should add frequent flyer miles to my account..  a long, incredibly frustrating day",0
" no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself",0
 I waited on hold for too long. I shouldn't have to wait on hold forever when I never received a confirm. in the 1st place ,0
" Been dealing w/  to solve the probs your team created. Your Manch, NH staff is clearly your C-team, btw. ",0

" captain on flight 1712 from PHX-PHL at 3:55 tonight was hilarious. ""Greetings from the pointy end of the airplane"" haha thanks!",1
 worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable ,0
 I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min,0
 3 delays 2 Cancelled Flightlations a double layover and 72 hours Late Flightr....could I at least get extra dividend miles?,0
 I didn't take my original flight. I was suppose to arrive last night than by 2:00pm today. Didn't get in til 5,0
" sitting for 30 minutes on the runway at dca, because your gates are full? Early landing, Late Flight flight.",0
  LET US OFF THIS PLANE!!!  please go to a gate.  This is absurd.,0
  2 trips in a row with missing luggage. Just like last time. I pay for baggage to be transported.,0
 lost our luggage. ,0
 really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?!,0
 Thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. ,0
 : its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help,0
" : i have been trying to reach dividend miles  to extend my ticket for last 3 days , 20 + calls and i get a message to call back",0
 how does an airline misplace an airline attendant?!! been at Reagan airport since 1pm10:15 to Cincy is delayed trying to find her,0
 My flight finally arrived in Charlotte.  They booked my luggage thru to lga but no room on flight for me.  What a mess,0
" been on hold for over an hour, still don't know where my bags are, won't refund me my flight?!?! It wasn't weather!!",0
 no your not!,0
 My wife had flight changes due to weather now she cant checkin to her return flight and it fails Is it possible usair Cancelled Flightled,0
 thank you for fixing my 5 hour delay.,1
 yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing,0
 this is more than having patience. This is not acceptable. http://t.co/N7pSuEJDC8,0
 4 flights in 48hrs &amp; I've had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. Freaky coincidence! Plus side she's great. :),1
 landed safely everything worked out.,1
 can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I'm dumb and should be using a different airline ,0
 you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.,0
 delays to the max,0
 on Sunday! Can't wait! See you then,1
 well this is    trying to make   http://t.co/m7MMq2f5FA,0
 it shouldn't take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far,0
" attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day, site unable to retrieve details.  Called twice and disconnected.",0
 Emailed them a week ago and still nothing...,0
 I would be willing to pay anything to change a flight!  does not! help!,0
 yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE,0
 still waiting! Captain reports he's called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway.  Flightr,0
 is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa.,0
 finally rectified my flight situation! Thanks again,1
 on time today and from PHL! Nice work! ,1
 you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. ,0
 I have been doing that all day. Can't find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX.,0
 why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving  Flightr,0
 being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. You can't even tell me when my bags will be here,0
 ice cream up front! Solid,1
 shout out to the pilots and FC attendant(Eliz) of US 673. Super strong crosswinds during landing. Eliz did a super job throughout,1
 now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!,0
" Your software is broken. ""Call Customer Support"" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers.",0
 It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.,0
"  hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit?",0
 delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change ,0
 Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.,0
 ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.,0
 I was re accommodated for my DSM flight tonight after a delay from Myrtle Beach now the flight to DSM is back on for tonight?,0
 so far I've gotten six different answers,0
 Oh certainly. And now I have two $275 pending transactions on my bank account. Really happy that I was charged double.,0
" what's going on? I've been hearing a not-friendly 'Please wait' on repeat while I'm on hold, being transferred to idk where...",0
 The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good.,0
 I'm sorry as well. It's been 24 hrs without my bag and I can't get a straight answers. I'm on call  for today.,0
 Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs.,0
 I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.,0
 if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn't be stuck in horrible CLT now.,0
 you run a piece of shit airline!!  Thanks for ruining AA,0
‚Äú:  We appreciate the  for Roberto. DM confirmation code so we can forward ur kind words.‚Äù Confirmation code?,0
 Finally back on board.  Door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel. You think someone wd have thought of it earlier,0
" Secondary screenings, a piece of the plane missing... Anything you want to tell us?",0
  sitting on Tarmac in  for 30 min. No announcement. Just sitting.,0
" I appreciate that you actually monitor Twitter, so please  pass along my feedback. I've tried calling about 15 times in 4 days :(",0
 Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member.,0
 I don't think I've ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly.,0
 PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL,0
" once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks",0
 the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That's so wrong,0
". I'm delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good",0
 we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? ,0
"  she missed her uncle's funeral, and you ""hope"" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you.",0
 My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed.,0
 just lost a faithful customer.,0
  I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out,0
 Marsha M. at Myrtle Beach is the greatest! She deserves all the respect and praise there is! ,1
". Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins.   Now flight further delayed.   Don't lite a match either http://t.co/mT8sPlm02v",0
" Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided.",0
 it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys,0
 well this is about as worthless as your regular service.  A bunch of do nothings and idiots. ,0
 ...these changes as well to Late Flightr find out that the flight I was scheduled for isn't ready,0
" after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks ",0
" that's understandable, my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...I changed my plans to accommodate",0
  thanks! Now I just need to locate where my luggage is!,0
 we haven't departed yet so let's not get too high hopes.  But everything has been on schedule so far,1
" Thanks for showing interest...3880 to Greenville, SC.",0

  So my flight was Late Flight getting into charlotte so i miss my connector to Phoenix thanks again last time I EVER FLY USAIR,0

" to CLT from JFK nasty planes, dirty seats &amp; floors, rude flight attendants- hopefully AA can get you cleaned up  ",0
 I paid for my ticket on  on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account.,0
 ok thank you we were told ground delay due to snow.,1
 this made me have to Cancelled Flight my car reservation and it came out to more money...why did you reschedule a time without the crew?,0
" my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday and moved to today, then while at my stop in DC my flight is delayed due to lack of crew US4485",0

 I've been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering.,0
 thanks.,1
 You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again...,0
 thanks to Betty working gate at ILM and lovely gate agents here in CLT helping me get home 2 Phx tonight instead of tomorrow,1
 I realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting Cancelled Flighted. Please prioritize ur passengers and help them,0
 how does that help me when I get no response from there??? ,0
   team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! ,0
 surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks!,1
 stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. ,0
 strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. ,0
 had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather  was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again,0
 What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?,0
 No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr.  ,0
 you can't even track my bag to see where it is. It's like it's disappeared.,0
 Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel &amp; I've submitted twice online,0
" I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !!",0
 is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.,0
 I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight,0
 I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend,0
 I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service,0
 only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage,0
" Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off.",0
 I have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport,0
 the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?,0
" so mad I can't even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher",0
" Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I'd like an answer.",0
: I experienced what defines customer service on . A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges,0
 I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.,0
 that wasn‚Äôt my Q but thanks. Wondering why you‚Äôre the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) http://t.co/uH6UwuOSC0,0

Yes but I will nvr fly w/  I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn't see my father be4 they put him in a coma,0
 40 minutes to put my TSA number in‚Ä¶ 40 mins‚Ä¶ and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. ,0
 so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? ,0
" really, so what does that mean??? ",0
 thanks!  Can you help remind the agents it's ok?  Ps. Heard rumors of a streaming wifi TV/movie service you might be installing,1
" nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. ",0
" the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone.",0
 would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?,0
 would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?,0
" would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire",0
 would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?,0
 a $100  - totaled. Not happy. Not at all.,0
 I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply's ,0
" the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is ""I don't really know what happened""",0

 would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible,0
" that's ok, just know that I'll most likely never book with you again",0
 I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around.  Your service SUCKS ,0
" I don't mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn't have had to.  The airport has more room and you know.. food!",0
" That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks.",0
 why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?,0
 I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway,0
" I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers ",0
 Yeah I know that...but now I'll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week,0
 yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.,0
" 
Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in 'y'?",0

 your agent did not say,0
" no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho",0
 they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy?,0
" It is the 2nd person when I called again to ask, could not catch her name, rejected the request",0
 must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! ,0

 now on 5th plane of the day. First 4 all taken out of svc. Scheduled dep 3 p.m. Still on ground ORD 10:45pm,0
 Joanne from your San Diego staff was phenomenal! Give that girl a raise. She handled our  better than anyone.,1
 you are beyond redemption. Jfk. Baggage claim looks like a luggage warehouse,0
 thanks to AA / DART for getting me home in time for work this morning DEN-DFW... didn't have to waste a vaca day ,1
" even followed me, but I still can't get them to answer their phones. Worst. Customer ""service"". Ever.  ",0
 yeah and what are they gunna? Nothing your whole organization is a joke,0
 My sister just received a call that her trip Wednesday (flts 2348/3499) was Cancelled Flightled and resched to next day. Why?,0
" Great, then tell me how you will fix it?        ",0
 2hr and 20 min delayed...still waiting...you need to do something to improve... http://t.co/1m36NTPTR8,0
 It says on you web site that u fly directly from ORD to DUB. when I try to book it says you do not. Have you stopped ?,0
 Glad to hear that there were no serious injuries in the minor crash  this evening.,1
 I booked it on US Airways site. Don't see a Cancelled Flight link :(,0
 we had to sit in the airport a long periolodicly time. the planes were nasty,0
 no space in my seat but thanks to your pilots I'm back 25mn early to Ohare!! Didn't think that was possible!!  ,1
 Late Flight again geez flt2417  Flight  ,0
" to add insult to injury, I have to go pick it up myself. Real class act! I'll stick the Delta from now on.",0
 absolutely disappointed in your lack of service. Lost my bag and can't even deliver it after I was told it would happen.,0
 Just followed you.,1
 what can AA do for a load of people about to board their 5th plane of a very long day when the first 4 were unserviceable,0
 what is going on with the flight 2417? It has been delay a lot .,0
 We tried with multiple people. I already sat on the phone for an hour and a half and got nowhere.,0
 which one.?i have been booked on 6 different ones in the past 2 days,0
" Nope. Couldn't make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed.",0
" doesn't care about customers, break your gear and tell u they can't do anything.     ",0
 unable to access the website.  Will try again.,0
 Best planes in the business. NOT? AA5411 today. http://t.co/I7Vdi9WqSF,0
 I loved todays fight. But there was a bad draft on the airplane please add more air to air thanksm,0
Keep it up :) ,1
  . Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.,0
 thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.,0
 seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.,0
 this is the biggest joke I've ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke,0
 Pay for my accommodations when you are the ones Cancelled Flightling it for no reason and I know your saying (lying) it cause of weather,0
 airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will,0
 This is getting a bit ridiculous when and you have made me miss 2 full days off work and had to pay for cabs back and forth,0
 your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient,0
 Cancelled Flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was Cancelled Flight,0
 Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have,0
 WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.,0
 I've just received the ticket. Thank you for your help,1
 This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...,0
" on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane, now the lines are frozen.",0
 so disappointed with this airline never again will I book with you guys,0
 thanks,1
" You found my lost luggage, won't bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn't nicer. Terrible service",0
 Would it be ok to send you a DM asking a few questions because i'm deaf and been on hold so long?,0
" ""sorry you were disappointed""   have kids and jobs",0
  It's not allowing me to book available seats,0
" seriously, all flights from Detroit to Dallas are Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row. I want to get home &amp; see my wife &amp; kids.",0
 of delays and trapped on planes with no water or air. Never ever ever again.  ,0
 LITERALLY just told me they'd rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp; take me to Dr. appointment. WOW,0
 we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern,0
 I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge ,0
 thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting,0
" If it's in my backpack, why do I need to see agent?",0
 I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice,0
 she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.,0
 Hi AA ! I placed an itin on hold to expire on 2/27.Just logged into my acct..its gone! Seat hasn't been released to inv. Help?,0
"  TPA - ORD!!! AA1679 Another successful journey, thanks for the hospitality!",1
 Thank you for the response. Much appreciated!,1
 4369. about 4 flights all using same gate w/buses to the planes.  Awful boarding process. Hour and a half Late Flight,0
 is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money?,0
"  After days, I finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! This is beyond ridicules.  help!",0
 Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn't even try to help!,0
" thanks.  I actually made it, my connection flight was delayed.  Guess all delays are not a bad thing. http://t.co/XGgCNTco8m",1
 the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.,0
 thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami,0
 an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.,0
 I'm here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! ,0
 right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.,0
" obviously we did see an agent-booked us for tomorrow morning. No hotel, no transportation.   ",0
 I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I'm not. I've been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous,0
 you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting,0
 still on hold. After you hung up on me the first time (another 45 minutes!) http://t.co/IMRLAu77iH,0
 if it I have not rebooked didn't get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled,0
"‚Äú:  Thanks for the shout-out, Candace! Enjoy the ride.‚Äù Always! I adore American Airlines!",1
"Without notifying though? ‚Äú:  We don't like Cancelled Flightling flights, Kim, but weather has not played nice with us.""",0
"Still thinking, those PJs may have me sold   We'd  to have you on board with us!  here I come",1
 how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty,0
 customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money,0
 im still on hold...,0
 you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It's because your airline sucks.,0
 Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!,0
 . Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.,0
  thanks!,1
"   flight  delayed from POS-MIA, missed  MIA- ATL need seat on last flight to ATL.",0
" SO BAD service in Miami, AirPort..",0
 needs an entire customer service overhaul  would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service,0
 are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money?,0
" why do you continually play the ""according to federal regulations"" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service...",0
" thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. Does that mean I have to go to the airport?????",0
 the folks at the Executive Platinum desk are great pros.  They understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to SW.,1
 He thanks you. Anything you can do to help. Would any further information help in the process?,1
 thanks for a Cancelled Flightled flight then a delayed flight and NOT telling us More missed work More $ on hotel ,0
 Flight 3487 delayed 1 hour because of pilots? I spend 5+ hours on the phone just to get an EP agent on the phone now this?,0
. Advised GAs and pilot of my flight. Too bad no one took action.,0
  need to be reported to the  for their complete disregard for paying customers! ,0
 how about you give us a number to call instead of the empty email since you are not working on it,0
" I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I'm disappointed.",0
 congrats on your call center customer service! A guy named Fidencio answered and he went above &amp; beyond to help me! üëåüëåüëå,1
 Gabriela in Miami is a very rude employee.Working the MIA-LGA check In. She made experience unpleasant.  ,0
 ok makes no sense tho Since you'll give me a free upgrade to first.,0
" I didn't want to Cancelled Flight, I wanted to take someone off and keep my price. Held at 402, at 10am today 440, now 530",0
 it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.,0
" would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?",0
 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central.  About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central.,0
"  despite the inconvenience, the situation was handled quickly and we appreciate it very much!",1
 Absolutely!,1

"  just received it, actually. Thank you!!!!!!!!!",1
 have such a bad rep for loosing costumers luggage. I stopped flying them a while back.,0

" oh I did. All I received back was an email saying "" delays happen"".. Uh huh..",0
 How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.,0
 Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. ,0
 why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight,0
 Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.,0
" yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing.",0
 why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane,0
 you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?,0
 stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating,0

 has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.,0

 how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS.,0
 Flight for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. New one booked. Seats taken care of. Just a tweet to commend you all on the service. Thanks!,1
 instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume,0
 he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out.,0
 I guess it is more BS AirportCardio given you cannot have an on time flight,0
 you should really explain customer service to your gate agent for 1152 at C4. Couldn't be bothered.,0

 What's with your baggage handlers calling out at DFW today? No luggage onboard the planes.,0
". after 50 minutes on hold, and another 30 minutes on the call yes. Going to be pushing it to get to the airport on time now",0
 your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.,0
" why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?",0
 from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day,0
" Agents in DFW were very kind did their best to help, but this doesn't make up for PHX error and attitude! ",0
 will not let me reuse my ticket.  Thus I have booked my vacation with Delta!  Never flying on American again......,0
